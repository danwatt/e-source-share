# e-source-share

There are many source sharing, code pasting sites out there today. Very few meet a critical requirement
of enterprises - code should not be shared outside of the company. There are some self-hosted solutions
out there, but many of them come packaged in enterprise-unfriendly langauges like PHP.

e-source-share is designed to be a code copy/paste sharing application, that can be deployed to the most
common enterprise architecture there is - Java.

## In All Seriousness...
Joking about "enterprise" and "enterprisey" aside, this application is designed to provide a quick place
for developers inside an organization that cares about security to copy and paste code. More importantly,
the author is developing this as a simple example of how to build a Spring 3.2 application.
